        <h2>A Mexican Classic</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        Let me introduce you to a Mexican classic, our dilicious <em>chilaquiles</em>. It's a very simple dish made of <em>totopos</em> covered in a classic red salsa. The heat from the salsa combined with an egg, is one of the best things I have ever
        had for breakfast. Here you will find two of the three key ingredients in Mexcan cusine, <em>corn</em> and <em>chile</em>. They graciously come together, paired with some of our favorite aromatics. The ingredients all do such a great job at enhancing
        all those delicious flavors Mexican cusine is known for.

            They say that flavor can really take you back in time. There's always a dish that can awaken memories of those who we love. This meal does that for me. I remember as a child, I would visit my grandmother often. Every single time I would arrive at her
            house, she would ask me what I wanted her to make for us to eat. It never failed, the same question time and time again with the same answer, <em>chilaquiles</em>.

        You can pair <em>chilaquiles</em> with an egg on top. Crumble some cheese and finish garnis with some cilantro. You can also have them on their own with some sour cream and <em>queso fresco</em>. That is the beauty of Mexican cusine, you can add,
        combine, take so many of the incredible ingredients that we have available. <em>Chilaquiles</em> can be made as spicy as you can take them or as mild as you prefer them. It takes a little practice but adjusting the level of spiciness in our cusine
        is doable. Some will add an even hotter <em>salsa</em> on top of the already spicy meal. It just really all depends on what you like and prefer.
