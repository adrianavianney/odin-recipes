                <em>Huevos Rancheros</em> is another simple and fast, yet packed full of flavor, classic served throughout Mexico. I find myself making this myself a lot. It's a recipe I picked up soon after moving out of my house, and have made it at
                least once a week since. You can say that this was the recipe that brought me into adulthood. I feel like we all have that one recipe we had over and over when we were first on our own and this was the one for me. It introduced me to the
                classic three ingredients that I have continously used throughout the years as I explored Mexican cuisin deeper.

            <p>I love the combination of flavors and aromas created by the ingredients in this recipe. It is truly amazing the variety of dishes that can be created with just a few ingredients. The simplicty of the dish allows it to be paired with other
                ingredients found throughout many Mexican dishes. Things like cilantro, avocado and sour cream have enhanced our food for centuries. This dish consists of a toasted tortilla, topped with a fried egg and accompanied with a side of beans.
                The finishing touches come with a cilantro garnish and a dollop of sour cream.

            <p>This is definitely a regular in our home. This is also the dish that opened the world of culinary experiences for my husband. It was the first breakfast I made him and he fell in love. Before he wasn't interested in much. His meals were very
                plain and lacked a variety of flavors. Having this dish helped him learn that there are ways to have vegetables in an enjoyable way. Ever since he ate this he fell in love with Mexican food and constantly asks me to make it for me. He's
                had his fair share of attempts at it but says that it just doesn't taste the same. I always remind him that cooking is about trial and error. As long as you have fun, the flavors will fall in place with practice.
