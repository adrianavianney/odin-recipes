                Mexican scramble, or as we know it <em>huevos mexicanos</em>, is a classic Mexican breakfast that I remember having throughout my childhood. I find it very amusing how surprising so many people find it that I was eating jalapeno peppers
                before I could even tie my shoes. As a child I never really paid much mind to it. Now as a parent myself, I can see where they were coming from. Although, it might seem strange to some, to us who grew up eating like this, we just wouldn't
                trade it for the world.

            There is just something about the smell of grilled onion and jalapeno in the mornings that get me up and ready for the day. I can admit that these simple ingredients have a better effect on my brain than coffee. The aromatics released throughout my home
            take me back to version of me, way before adulthood set in. The times when my grandma would yell from the other side of the house, to get our shoes on and hurry out to eat our breakfast. The woman would never send us to school on an empty
            stomach. How she did it in her eighties, I will never know.

        I wanted to share this recipe because although it's so simple, it's filled with so much flavor. If you can handle a little heat (well, honestly that just really depends on your peppers) I would recommend this dish. You can quickly toss it together and
        pair it with some refried beans and tortilla. If you are feeling a little bold, you can even top it off with some classic <em>queso fresco</em> or even a little stronger
        <em>queso cotija</em>. Let's get right to it, <em>provecho.</em>

    <div>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Separately dice your tomato, jalapeno and onion and put to the side</li>
                <li>Turn your range to medium heat and heat up your pan. Once that is heated put your oil in.</li>
                <li>Once the oil is heated toss your onions in and let them grill until they appear a bit transparent. Toss as needed for an even grill.</li>
                <li>When the onions seem transparent put the jalapeno in and let it grill for a couple of minutes. In a clean bowl, crack open your eggs and mix until they appear and even shade of yellow. Set to the side.</li>
                <li>Get your tomato and toss in the pan with your onion and jalapeno. Grill until soft.</li>
                <li>Take the eggs you already mixed and throw them in the pan. Toss your eggs and veggies together mixing them evenly</li>
                <li>Season to taste, mix and once eggs are cooked to your preference, serve</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

                You can serve with a side of refried beans and some tortillas. I highly recommend topping it with an authentic salsa for extra heat and flavor!
